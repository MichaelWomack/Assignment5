# Assignment5

The purpose of this assignment is to reinforce linear data structure concepts.  Specifically, the assigment is to the following 3 problems.

1) Write a program that finds the maximum increasingly ordered subsequence of characters in a string.  Analyze the time complexity of your program.
2) Write a program that obtains the execution time for finding the GCD of every two consecutive Fibonacci numbers from the index 40 to index 45 using the 
   algorithms in Listings 22.3 and 22.4 in the text.  Display the results in a table.
3) Write a method that uses the divide-and-conquer approach to find the smallest number in an array.  Test your method with multiple arrays.
